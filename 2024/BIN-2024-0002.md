## Requirements

Deploying an experimental soft fork for testing on a global signet has different requirements to deploying a soft fork on mainnet.

In particular:

 * the codebase must support triggering soft fork activation on signet at different heights, as custom signets may not activate at the same height or time as the global signet

 * in the event of a proposed soft fork being found to be buggy, and the specification being updated incompatibly when the bug is fixed, activated soft forks must be able to be rolled back so that the new version of the specification can be tested without triggering a hard fork event

 * activations should be able to take place relatively quickly, so that testing is convenient, rather than spending months to allow coordination amongst miners and users

To emphasise this difference, we're calling this deployment method "heretical".

## Specification

The way heretical deployments are designed is as follows:

 * Four configuration parameters are set:
   * `int32_t signal_activate, signal_abandon` -- version numbers used to signal activation/abandonment of the soft fork via the block header
   * `start_time` -- used to control when signalling can begin
   * `timeout` -- used to set a fixed timeout at which the soft fork will always be automatically abandoned

 * `signal_activate` and `signal_abandon` should be derived from the 27-bit BINANA number of the soft fork as follows:
   * `binana_id = ((year % 32) << 22) | ((number % 16384) << 8) | (revision % 256)`
   * `signal_activate = 0x6000_0000 | binana_id`
   * `signal_abandon = 0x4000_0000 | binana_id`

A state machine similar to BIP9 is used to coordinate activation based on these parameters, with the state updating every 432 blocks (3 days)

 * The following states are defined:
   * `DEFINED` - inactive, initial state, waiting for `start_time`
   * `STARTED` - inactive, waiting for signal or `timeout`
   * `LOCKED_IN` - inactive, will be active next period
   * `ACTIVE` - active, waiting for `signal_abandon` or timeout
   * `DEACTIVATING` - active, but will be abandoned next period
   * `ABANDONED` - inactive, terminal state

 * The transitions to activate a fork look like `DEFINED -> STARTED -> LOCKED_IN -> ACTIVE`, with `STARTED` being triggered by median time reaching `start_time` and `LOCKED_IN` being triggered by a block being mined with `nVersion == signal_activate`.

 * The transitions to abandon a fork look like:
   * `DEFINED -> ABANDONED` - only if timeout is reached
   * `STARTED -> ABANDONED` - if timeout is reached or `nVersion == signal_abandon` is seen (overrides the `STARTED -> LOCKED_IN` transition if a block with `nVersion == signal_activate` occurs in the same period)
   * `LOCKED_IN or ACTIVE -> DEACTIVATING -> ABANDONED` - if timeout is reached or `nVersion == signal_abandon` is observed in `LOCKED_IN` or `ACTIVE`

(Note: there is no option for a signet to transition a soft fork back to `ACTIVE` if a `signal_abandon` block is mined. Maybe there should be; and a terminal state should only occur via the `timeout`? On the other hand, because signet is permissioned, the miners could always trigger a large reorg of the chain to put it back in an earlier state to undo an unwanted soft fork abandonment)

## Implementation notes

The following notes are specific to developers and users working with the Bitcoin Inquisition node software.

### Developing a soft fork

As a proposer of a new soft fork, the idea is that you set deployment parameters like this:

```c++
        consensus.vDeployments[Consensus::DEPLOYMENT_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY] = SetupDeployment{
            .binana_year = 2024,
            .binana_id = 000,
            .binana_revision = 000,
            .start = 1654041600, // 2022-06-01
            .timeout = 1969660800, // 2032-06-01
        };
```

The `start` time and `binana_revision` should be updated each time the proposal is updated in any way that renders the proposal not fully compatible with prior revisions. The `timeout` should normally be set to 10 years after the start time. Note that this means the `start` time should almost always be in the past, since the proposal text should usually be updated before code is committed and merged.

With 256 values for `binana_revision` available, this allows for an incompatible update approximately every month over a 10 year period, without causing any ambiguity and allowing clients implementing different versions of the spec to be consensus compatible.

### Mining a signet

As a miner of a signet, you can support testing a proposed soft fork by doing the following:

 * Updating your mining/block-signing nodes to run bitcoin-inquisition rather than bitcoin core
 * Mining a block with `nVersion = signal_activate`
 * Waiting up to 6 days for the state to transition from `STARTED` through `LOCKED_IN` to `ACTIVE`. Manually mining up to 864 blocks as quickly as possible can reduce this time, of course.

If a soft fork proposal has an incompatible update, bumping `binana_revision` from `A` to `B`, you should proceed as follows:

 * Mine a block with `nVersion = signal_abandon_A` to signal that you will no longer be supporting the old version of the fork
 * Mine a block with `nVersion = signal_activate_B` to signal that you will be supporting the new version of the fork.
 * Continue running the software supporting version `A` while the deployment transitions from `ACTIVE` through `DEACTIVATING` until it reaches `ABANDONED`. These states can be observed by invoking `bitcoin-cli -signet getdeploymentinfo`
 * Once version `A` is inactive, upgrade your mining software to support version `B`.
 * If both signalling blocks were in the same period, version `B` will already be `ACTIVE` and ready to use, otherwise it will be `LOCKED_IN` and ready to use after 432 blocks are mined.

Note that signalling for activation of a new version `B` should be done after signalling for abandonment of any prior version that was activated. Not doing so may cause a hard fork event; that is, it may cause users running versions of bitcoin that enforce version `A` of the soft fork to cease being able to follow the chain once transactions/blocks following the rules in version `B` are included in the chain.

(Some consideration should probably be given to how the chain behaves if a bug in the soft fork implementation causes it to be a hard fork compared to bitcoin core's consensus rules)

(The `contrib/signet/miner` software currently does not have any special support for doing this signalling)

### Using a signet

In order to test a proposed soft fork that has been merged into the bitcoin inquisition codebase, a user needs to:

 * switch their software from bitcoin core to bitcoin inquisition
 * use a signet whose miners are activating the soft fork (which can be observed by running `bitcoin-cli -signet getdeploymentinfo` after syncing)

In the event that a soft fork is updated from version `A` to version `B`, users may want to recover any funds they have locked under the version `A` rules. In that case, they may observe that miners are deactivating version `A` by watching for the `DEACTIVATING` state via `getdeploymentinfo`, and will have 432 blocks in this state to recover their funds. (This feature relies on the signet miners signalling for abandonment of `A` prior to activation of `B`, and continuing to run software supporting version `A` until it is inactive)

In the event that you wish to disable a particular soft fork, despite it being active on the signet you're following, you can deactivate it by using the `-renounce` option; eg `bitcoind -renounce=checktemplateverify`.
