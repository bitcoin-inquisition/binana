## Abstract

This BIP describes a new tapscript opcode (`OP_INTERNALKEY`) which
pushes the taproot internal key to the stack.

## Specification

When verifying taproot script spends having leaf version 0xc0 (as defined in
BIP342), `OP_INTERNALKEY` replaces `OP_SUCCESS203`
(0xcb). `OP_INTERNALKEY` pushes the taproot internal key, as defined
in BIP341, to the stack.

## Motivation

### Key spend with additional conditions

When building taproot outputs, especially those secured by an aggregate key
representing more than 1 signer; the parties may wish to collaborate on signing
with the taproot internal key, but only with additional script restrictions. In
this case, `OP_INTERNALKEY` saves 32 bytes of witness space.

### Mitigated control block overhead for scripts using hash locks

In cases where script path spending is not desired, the internal key may be set
to a NUMS point whose bytes would otherwise be required in a tapscript. This
could be used with any hash locked transaction, for example, to save 32 witness
bytes.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation is provided here:

## Backward Compatibility

By constraining the behavior of an OP_SUCCESS opcode, deployment of the BIP can
be done in a backwards compatible, soft-fork manner. If anyone were to rely on
the OP_SUCCESS behavior of `OP_SUCCESS203`,
`OP_INTERNALKEY` would invalidate their spend.

## Deployment

TBD
